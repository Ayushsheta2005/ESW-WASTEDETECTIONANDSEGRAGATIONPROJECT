## **Introduction**
The **Smart Waste Segregator Model (SSM)** is a comprehensive solution designed to address waste management challenges by automating waste detection, classification, and segregation. Leveraging advanced computer vision techniques and hardware integration, SSM classifies waste into three categories: **Recyclable**, **Non-Recyclable**, and **Hazardous**, enabling efficient waste disposal and promoting environmental sustainability.

---

## **Objectives**
- Automatically detect and classify waste using advanced deep learning algorithms and computer vision techniques.
- Efficiently segregate waste into three broad categories: **Recyclable**, **Non-Recyclable**, and **Hazardous**.
- Enhance recycling efficiency and environmental sustainability.
- Utilize scalable hardware-software integration to address real-world waste management challenges.

## **Solution Pipeline**

### 1. **Data Input**
Real-time waste images are captured using camera modules and fed into a deep learning model for classification.

### 2. **Image Classification**
- The **YOLOv8-based computer vision model** classifies waste into:
  - **Recyclable**: Cardboard boxes, plastic bottles, aluminum cans, etc.
  - **Non-Recyclable**: Plastic bags, snack wrappers, plastic containers, etc.
  - **Hazardous**: Batteries, light bulbs, etc.

### 3. **Waste Disposal**
The system directs waste to the appropriate bin or disposal mechanism based on its classification.

### 4. **Waste Segregation**
Segregates waste into distinct bins for further processing or disposal.
